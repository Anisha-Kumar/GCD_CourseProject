# Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

the run_analysis.r script processes the raw data collected from accelerometers from
the samsung Galaxy S smartphone in a machine learning project.
The data is available from:

Specifically the script merges the test and training sets and creates a new tidy dataset.
This dataset contains the the average of the mean and standard deviation values for each accelerometer reading. This averages are presented tabulated by activity and subject (participant number).
